= Unsupported Characters

In general, avoid to use file/folder names with unusual characters, also try to
avoid white space although the tool should be able to handle white space. The problem
with unusual characters is the different interpretation of the respective file
by *git ls-files* and by the *stat* tool which provides the metadata. If keeping
files with odd characters, set the following values in the git config

[source,shell]
----
git config core.precomposeunicode true
git config core.quotepath false
----

NOTE: This must be done for each *git-metadata* client of the respective repository!
