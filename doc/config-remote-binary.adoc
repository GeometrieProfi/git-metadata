= Remote Binary

It is possible to add one or more remote repository for the binaries,
independently if a remote git repository exists or has been set up. Upload
and download of files is done by *rsync*. Again a remote repo for binaries
is added via the git-config, use the prefix _remote-binary_ and a unique name
to identify it. For instance,

[source,shell]
----
git config --file=.gitconfig remote-binary.alpha dude@my-bin-server:/some-volume/picture
----
defines a remote binary repo named <alpha> within the file _.gitconfig_ and all files
and directories in your local folder are uploaded/downloaded by the respective
push/pull action to the remote _picture_ folder. Trailing slashes in the url
will be ignored.

If the remote-binary name or url should not be shared, it is also possible to define
it in the local _.git/config_ file as well:
[source,shell]
----
git config remote-binary.beta dude@my-bin-server:/some-volume/hidden
----
