= Pull

In order to pull from a remote binary repository a remote-binary must be set up
beforehand, see the respective config section. Synchronization is done by *rsync*.

[source,shell]
----
git metadata pull <remote-binary>
----

does a downstream synchronization with deletion of local files that are missing remote if

i) local binaries did not change since last successful local metadata update
ii) remote binaries are ahead of local binaries
iii) latest metadata update in git repository represents metadata of remote binaries

A force pull can be done with the optional argument *--force*:
[source,shell]
----
git metadata pull --force <remote-binary>
----

In this case only the requirement (iii) will be checked before calling *rsync*.
