= The file .gitconfig

_.gitconfig_ is used to share git config values. It should contain the default
branch used for metadata tracking which can be retrieved by

[source,shell]
----
git config --file=.gitconfig metadata.branch
----
The value is set by the *git-metadata init* command and should not be changed. Notice
that the default tracking branch is shared between clients meaning that the information
must be committed and can not be in client git config. Adding remote binary repositories
is optional and can be done within the _.git/config_ file or within _.gitconfig_.
